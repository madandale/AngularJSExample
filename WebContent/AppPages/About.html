        OrphanCARE Foundation is a non-profit non-governmental organisation established in 2008, under the patronage of HRH Sultanah Pahang, Sultanah Hajjah Kalsom.  It aims to give every orphan and abandoned baby a chance to feel love and care in the security of a family in accordance to our tagline
Every Child Needs A Family
“OrphanCARE is not an orphanage but a transit center for babies and children pending adoption”
We work closely with the Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development to expedite the adoption process whereby abandoned babies and children in orphanages are quickly matched up and placed with suitable parents.There is a disturbingly high number of orphans and unwanted babies placed in orphanages which is surprising considering that there are many couples who wish to adopt.
OrphanCARE is perhaps the only NGO seeking to reduce the number of children in orphanages. Most orphanages are often ill-resourced to provide children the kind of love, attention and security that could be offered by families.  Orphans and children who spend large parts of their childhood in orphanages often grow up with low self esteem resulting in behavioral problems, delinquency and  poor academic performance.   Many leave orphanages at the age of 18 without a family support system making it difficult for them to make a good start in life.
OrphanCARE  aims to help change society’s mindset towards orphans, recognizing that children should not be left permanently in orphanages which should really only be ‘transit points’ before they are placed with families who can bring them up in a proper family structure.

 
There are an increasing numbers of babies left in waste dumps, bushes, drains, public toilets among other places.  Unwed mothers or victims of rape who abandon their babies are mostly young and come under pressure arising from social stigma and legal implications, compounded by a sense of hopelessness due to not knowing whom to turn to.
Our baby hatch, the first such facility in Malaysia, was set up to discourage women from abandoning their babies by providing the assurance that the babies would be placed in good homes.
OrphanCARE has a database of screened adoptive parents with complete background profiles and work with other Government departments, NGOs and members of the public to provide suitable families for orphans and abandoned babies.
 
At OrphanCARE we believe “Every child needs a family”.
